    <h2>The History behind our Name</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        Founding partners in the original Mappins location, 1979
        Mappins was founded as a small à-la-carte restaurant in Brampton in 1979 by James Chiu, George Chiu, Diana Chiu, and K.C. Chang. Their top priority was to ensure customer satisfaction by providing the freshest food and the best service.
        In 1986, they changed their restaurant to buffet-style to accommodate the long line-ups of customers waiting to try their much talked about cuisine. They continuously maintained their commitment to customer satisfaction. This commitment is the basis of the company’s mission statement: “Every customer must feel welcomed as soon as they arrive. Every customer must be happy and smiling when they leave”.
        Each location is owned and operated by Front and Kitchen Managing Partners who have been promoted from within the organization. All of the Managing Partners share the same goal of customer satisfaction that drove the four founding partners.
        The Mappins Restaurant corporate headquarters, located in Brampton, Ontario, is home to the head office, a warehouse, The Garden Banquet & Convention Centre, and Mappins Brampton, one of two corporately-owned restaurants.
        Mappins is proud to support the community. Over the years, the company has been recognized for its contributions to various hospitals, educational institutions, and charitable organizations. Mappins continues to win numerous consumer choice awards, including being named Best Buffet by Toronto Sun readers for over 20 years.
